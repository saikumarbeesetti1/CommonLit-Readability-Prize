# CommonLit-Readability-Prize
Can machine learning identify the appropriate reading level of a passage of text, and help inspire learning? Reading is an essential skill for academic success. When students have access to engaging passages offering the right level of challenge, they naturally develop reading skills.    In this competition, we're predicting the reading ease of excerpts from literature. We've provided excerpts from several time periods and a wide range of reading ease scores. Note that the test set includes a slightly larger proportion of modern texts (the type of texts we want to generalize to) than the training set.
